Summary: A Contacts CRUD mobile application with Push notification integration.   
Target Product: Mobile   
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2, EAP 6.3

## What is it?

This project is an Android mobile front-end to the [Contacts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-wfk-quickstarts/contacts-mobile-picketlink-secured) server application found in the [quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-wfk-quickstarts) of the Red Hat [JBoss Web Framework Kit](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/). All CRUD features are supported, as well as integration with the Push notification mechanism to instantly retrieve a new Contact when it is created on the server. A video demonstrating the application 'in-action' can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/97464515). 

## System requirements

* [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Maven 3.1.1](http://maven.apache.org)
* Latest [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and [Plataform version](http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/platforms.html)
* Latest [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html) and [Google Play Services](http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html)
* Latest [Maven Android SDK Deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer)


## Pre-requisites

* Both the [Contacts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-wfk-quickstarts/contacts-mobile-picketlink-secured) and the [AeroGear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server) applications up and running. Follow the documentation of each respective project to set them up.
* A valid configured variant on the UPS admin console as well as a valid Google API Key, and a device (Push notifications are not available on simulator). Follow the documentation on the [UPS guide](http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-android/) to set them up.


## Build and Deploy the Contacts

### Change Push Configuration

In [Contacts.java](./src/org/jboss/aerogear/unifiedpush/quickstart/Constants.java) find and replace BASE_URL,
UNIFIED_PUSH_URL, VARIANT_ID, SECRET and GCM_SENDER_ID:
```
// This is the base url for the contacts-mobile-picketlink-secured application.  
// For example (your IP/hostname will differ):  
String BASE_URL = "http://192.168.1.157:8080/jboss-contacts-mobile-picketlink-secured";

// This is the URL to the Unified Push Server.  
// For example (your IP/hostname will differ):  
String UNIFIED_PUSH_URL = "http://192.168.1.157:8080/ag-push";

// The variant id that which was generated when registering the variant.  
String VARIANT_ID = "";

// The secret that which was generated when registering the variant.  
String SECRET = "";

// Is the project number given in Googles APIs Console.  
String GCM_SENDER_ID = "";
```

### Application Flow

When you first launch the application, you are required to login. Enter your employee credentials (by default the 'Contacts' backend creates a list of default employees such as '_maria:maria_') and click Login. If the login is successfully, you are presented with a list of existing Contacts residing on the server.

Clicking a Contact reveals the edit screen where you can modify his/her details.

### Receiving Notifications

To test that you can successfully receive notifications when a new contact is created, open the web interface of the application and try to add a new Contact. Once done, and if the application is successfully configured, immediately you will see the notification popping up on the screen.
